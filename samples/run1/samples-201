 shame;
My father's daughter; whose face I would rather
Be seen; than I am shown.
But 'tis my father's daughter, in all;
And, in common estimation, more worthy.
And she is much loved by all,--in all,
More worthy than I would love her.
My mother, in all, with more affection,
For me.

BUCKINGHAM:
What say you, uncle?

HENRY BUCKINGHAM:
Prithee; what say you?

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, I am to blame for my father's death.

HENRY BUCKINGHAM:
What say you now?

HENRY BUCKINGHAM:
What word now?

BUCKINGHAM:
My boy; I love thy father.

HENRY BUCKINGHAM:
I love him more than you.

HENRY:
More than you?

BUCKINGHAM:
My god, so shall you know, thou seest my son,--

HENRY:
That was a traitor:
He shall be put to death,--

BUCKINGHAM:
O God!--
'Tis my brother,
He is my cousin.'

HENRY:
Away with thee.

BUCKINGHAM:
O God!
Why wilt thou ne'er!

HENRY:
I will help thee,
I pray your pardon:
I will do thee harm; and pray heaven
To pardon me!

BUCKINGHAM:
I will be the witness of thy deeds,--

HENRY:
O Lord! O Mercutius!
God, heaven, Mercutius! what is he to do?

BUCKINGHAM:
O dear father,
Who art not so loving!

POMPEY:
O father, God!

HENRY:
'Twas not a day since he left the prison;
But he is gone, he hath made prison:
He is out of that which is honourable;
But his good deeds, his good looks,
The good he says have deserved the good
I would say they did deserve. O,
'Tis a pity
That he should be so prone; 'twas not his
good looks that deserve the honour of them;
For he was, from honour towards himself,
Most likely to make our society:
And in honour of him may our looks
He would have done best. O, God!
O Mercutius!--

POMPEY:
What have you to do, father?

HENRY:
Well, come my son to me,--

HENRY:
O man! you are so mean to me!--

POMPEY:
What say you?

HENRY:
O Mercutius!

POMPEY:
What say you?

HENRY:
I tell thee, Mercutius,
I know the matter; and then I would not,
For my mother stands in the way of my mind.

POMPEY:
Fores, 'tis well to hear thee,--

HENRY:
Farewell!

PETRUCHIO:
No man
But you must go with us; you must not follow him.

HENRY:
No, son; no man; my Lord; what art thou,
Lord?

PETRUCHIO:
There is no man but to-morrow.

HENRY:
Farewell!
Where is Lord Angelo?

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, I will go by him again.

PETRUCHIO:
What will you be here to-day?

HENRY:
To-day; what will you be, then, boy?

PETRUCHIO:
I think; 'tis too ill-to-teach at,
For the best to be my home: to-morrow I go to-day.

HENRY:
You shall not go to-morrow?

PETRUCHIO:
Yes, sir, I will go by myself;
My fellow, not but for that, and I will take care.

HENRY:
What shall you be, then?

PETRUCHIO:
I will go by myself, and there I will stay;
For I go by myself, that I may teach you,
But shall not go by myself, since I love the
women. I may not love the women, sir
