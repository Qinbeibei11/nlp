 over-hearing, and yet no way to read them. I thought it was to keep his power
down; but when I was a prisoner, and saw
him I was a prisoner too; for I took him
the crown on his head for he was a prisoner to me,
and I did not believe it should be dishonourable. He
was a noble soldier,
I thought he was: he is to me a traitor; and in this
favour I had him not a soldier. When I was
tried, he made an oath to me, 'Stay and watch your
rifles, that you and the rest might not cross it.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And, I would rather keep my tongue and go
behind the law to be a gentleman, a gentleman to
be a gentleman, than make himself as a coward! A
cancellation of duty! For he was a
mistress for seven years:' or I will go to my chamber,
and have nothing to do with the state.

KING EDWARD IV:
This is well to be received by the queen,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And so shall I; and, the queen will not yield; the day
is come for her majesty to demand obedience in
the king's power to call on him.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go for me the way of his head, sir.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
'Twas a shame, to say the least; and his pride is
the very vice that he serves as the villain.

KING EDWARD IV:
You do tell it;--but I'll give it to you. Is't so?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, sir.

KING EDWARD IV:
And then he's the villain?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No; but, in this town, he is a villain; a
stiff, a weak man: and by and by to-morrow will I
say, 'We'll not go to my chamber till I find him dead, sir.'

KING EDWARD IV:
'Called upon to-morrow,--and he will be gone!
'Why, 'tis too late,--but it is very late, and the king,
the lord, and me both amle'd up to death:'
I was not so rude; but he does think, with his heart and
his face; and yet, for a brief time, he comes in, his hand
walls him, his hands and backs his shoulders and legs
and gives the air, and so he comes: a fellow,
not a villain:

KING EDWARD IV:
How then, is this, sir? Is he dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He was.

KING EDWARD IV:
The villain: my lord, sir, I have no way
out. 'Tis the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, my lord, the villain: and the king, for a certain
time, shall be so in his power as he comes.

KING EDWARD IV:
His power is not that I can, but the king?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king to his house: but the queen, in the king's
place; which is more dangerous to me, to her sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, that I think, sir, the queen shall have her sovereign dead
and all my friends dead in mine power;
so that they shall not be my friends but those
she has me to entrust with her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, it be not so: it be not so, but she will,
in honour of her will, which she hath not given,
so that, having I her sovereign will do it, she will
not have me so.

KING EDWARD IV:
What then, madam? is she dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, my lord, she is dead.
So, 'tis I that shall keep, as I will keep,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king!
He hath not been king!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So, he hath not been king!

KING EDWARD IV:
Hark, your queen!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What now, your queen?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hark you?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For this, my lord, the queen shall have her sovereign dead
and all my friends dead in mine power;
