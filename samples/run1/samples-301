 or not but had an adverse effect and that to our judgment not so fair a one can be. For we are all the more affected by this.

POLIXENES:
What's the matter?

ROMEO:
What's the matter?

PROSPERO:
I was provoked by your majesty's love for us.

MERCUTIO:
And made a vow of poverty
You promised my life to our death.

MERCUTIO:
I do not promise death but to have it.
What!

PROSPERO:
Pray God, I am not deceived!
I do not know but you were the most sensible
One in all. If we were men of our minds, why,
Were it not then that you promised to have our
death? To give you an example.

MERCUTIO:
Do you swear by this oath, and not
By any mean?

PROSPERO:
I do, but not the more so you may.

MERCUTIO:
You must swear it before we die.

PROSPERO:
O that was your promise, I wot it not.

MERCUTIO:
Do you mean by us to die? I do swear--

PROSPERO:
You must swear it.

MERCUTIO:
You must not die; swear it, you must.

MERCUTIO:
Not so fast as you like, so we should.

PROSPERO:
Not so quickly as you like, so we should.
I do promise you we will not yet be misled.

MERCUTIO:
We will not now, therefore, yet 'fore we lie, though
We must be too near by chance to do it.

MERCUTIO:
I do not swear it. The oath, if I may use it,--

PROSPERO:
You will not use it yet, thus betraying yourself?

MERCUTIO:
I will swear it, to God!

PROSPERO:
Then I think it is a most holy promise!

MERCUTIO:
Well, by this is it a little dishonour'd?

MERCUTIO:
Not a little one; but the most holy
One to die for us.

PROSPERO:
I do swear I shall!

MERCUTIO:
I do swear but against you.

MERCUTIO:
I will

PROSPERO:
O you you, that dare swear upon what
You will, then we must stand by but you swear upon
Death, but we'll do all else you said.

MERCUTIO:
Well, by all means.

PROSPERO:
Then I will swear death upon you.

MERCUTIO:
I will not, then what?

MERCUTIO:
I love you, your dear cousin; but I would
Death, to me, was neither good nor dreadful.

PROSPERO:
Why, that, were it more, would it be more, were it not so?
If you die, that's all you can think.

MERCUTIO:
No, not more.

PROSPERO:
I have said, that which I had so long vow'd, what
I have sworn to do, I will not to do.

MERCUTIO:
Why, then you shall swear;

PROSPERO:
God save your majesty!

MERCUTIO:
And you shall swear by me too, I swear to
Death, which is neither good nor dreadful,
Death both good and dreadful.

PROSPERO:
And God save you.

MERCUTIO:
I have done it, it is done.

MERCUTIO:
Go tell to death: that you have done, you must swear
Death by me, but as that I am yours.

MERCUTIO:
O, that is very dishonourful.

MERCUTIO:
I am a true Mercutio: and as well as, I
Though with such a spirit, as your Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
Marry's day.

MERCUTIO:
How long is it then?

MERCUTIO:
Ten-eigh-seven.

MERCUTIO:
How long would it be for our soul?

MERCUTIO:
The hour it began; that is, we thought we should be
A-day.
