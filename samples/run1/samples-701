 own.

VINCENTIO:
Ha!
He thinks your worship must peremptly
Take the present with you, and that the time be,
And you'll get possession of it.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis ten days since I was in any kind of
service. What! will my lord deliver us from our
burden?

HORTENSIO:
If the circumstances hereafter tell us
something of the heavy weight he places on you,
he'll straight perceive that your satisfaction is,
Within your time, within your discipline.

VINCENTIO:
You are past that time.

HORTENSIO:
Nay, come after me. What? you are past that.

VINCENTIO:
You were appointed a body-maid: call me a whore
Or a lout, if you will; for you are past that.

HORTENSIO:
I see you talk too much of the spirit.

VINCENTIO:
The spirit! why, the spirit!
Your worship should be a whore too, call me a
whore. Whores should be appointed whores should be appointed.

HORTENSIO:
You cannot and by mere circumstance will not go there.

VINCENTIO:
But were I appointed an o'clock prophet, I should
speak to-morrow: in a few minutes I should
speak to-day: I speak no news, I talk no words.

LUCIO:
You say are so resolved to leave Vienna you have not
come into any argument to hinder mine stay there.

VINCENTIO:
Why, I shall not be within ere I come within ere.

LUCIO:
We shall be mutually arbitrated between you and me;
if you do wrong one way or the other you are to
accept. For myself, I would prefer a quarrel with my
fellow: in that I cannot go to the fellow: I will hence.

ESCALUS:
I am going; and if the custom may be held to be
true that all the traffic brings about, most fieously
upon the traffic for the doing falsely.

ESCALUS:
Let me along: your honour must know my purpose.

LUCIO:
Why, now I know my purpose! What can you dispute with me?

ESCALUS:
Prithee, no more than meets meet your royal dad.

LUCIO:
You're welcome, your honour said.

ESCALUS:
I came to make a league with my fellow.

LUCIO:
You'll mar all, you'll meet any.

ESCALUS:
To do all, 'twere better chaste.

LUCIO:
Then thine are dogg'd: meet the friar, for he doth
matter so well.

ESCALUS:
Good goodby, my goodby, my goodby.

LUCIO:
So, what may be, may not be, piteous business?

ESCALUS:
That in the encounter of good or ill,
there is but one stand of resolution.

LUCIO:
Why, that many ways in the case of
question! But must I be ruled at large?

ESCALUS:
Are you counsell'd, my lord?

LUCIO:
Ay; and so may your honour,
on good Thursday in London, in private court.

ESCALUS:
Come, come, sir, I will go measure with you:
do you call the time now settled?

LUCIO:
Marry, I crave your honour to call it a night.

ESCALUS:
O, 'tis settled; we may call it that one night.

LUCIO:
Why, indeed,'tis settled, sir: and may be so.

ESCALUS:
Good Thursday, knights, as it is now settled,
I come to repair some more hours before
you arrive at it.

LUCIO:
Will not so?

ESCALUS:
Do you hear, noble sir?

LUCIO:
'Hie habe, friar: the Earl of Pembroke has in his store
commanded my servant out of the castle.

ESCALUS:
Come you to that?

LUCIO:
I will undertake to lodge you in some house,
Though this be untried a' the properties of
us. Lord Angelo here on the earth.
