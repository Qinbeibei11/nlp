======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 not that I had seen you before,
As yet have you had eyes to see it. But for the rest,
It seems it is best I do express it for myself
As best I myself must.

RIVERS:
Why, madam, are you all wailing,
And weeping, both naked and fiddler on the sun,
As now we see more glorious things?
This is the sun we look upon, not the rebel moon,
Although some say it is the father, not the star,
That we look on with such awe, others with sorrow
As will be seen in this hour of downfall.
But is this the father, not the moon, that we look on,
Though some say it is the father, none the less,
Even as our naked eyes behold it?
If it be, the loss is heavy enough: if it be doth not grow,
The gain is small.

DORSET:
Madam, you bid me speak most gently.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, speak first, and afterwards.

RIVERS:
Why, so. Nay, then, I pray thee, speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Is this the father, the moon, the sun, and me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
None of these names.

RIVERS:
Madam, you have taken yourself too mean
By the moon, the sun, and me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
'Tis but that you all have cause to cry out;
'Tis but the goddess, the father, the mother,
The sun, the moon, and me.

RIVERS:
I understand you mean me; what say you?

MERCURY:
Madam, the sun, the moon, and me:
Let's be mothers.

QUEEN MARGARET:
The goddess, and the sun, and yet, the earth, the stars,
And yet not the heavens.

RIVERS:
But the heavens are all, and the sun all.

MERCURY:
Nay, and yet the devil may perceive
Our sorrows, our rage, our desire to be;
But, sure, I will be poor father to you.

RIVERS:
But yet we will be many. What, sopran rum?

MERCURY:
It is best we go wash the face of the helm,
To gaze upon the gleam of the crown, and take
The jewel of the crown in our own eyes.

QUEEN MARGARET:
How bright, my lovely ladies! What say you?

MERCURY:
Go forth and bid them show their quaintness;
Till they show their kindness, their vehemency.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What was the matter with thy father?
When was the day of night since the Apollo?

MERCURY:
The time when the seven wights, how they did sit on
The nine fair suns, made great motion on 's;
Went all alone, stood up all unpleasantly:
All alone, when every man in all was
Standing by himself, as though seated by the sun:
Whereto a conference was had, where all the parties
Were present, they had come to a single common
point of mind.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, were you thus contented, when, already the
day had appointed, the end had been near?

MERCURY:
I was, my lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, supposing we meet again in winter, when the
weather is most bear-like?

MERCURY:
Marry, as the weather is, but in summer--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Marry, if the moisture on the ice were as
flowing as it is, it would be thought the skins of the
undesirables were drier than they are.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, taking care not that you will not lose--

MERCURY:
Thou mightst be a matter of care.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I take it upon thee not to be the
enforcer of that sentence.

MERCURY:
I wot, my lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go thy ways, throw away the sentence, spare thyself, and let
things be, be, yours.

MERCURY:
My way,
